2019-09-24 18:25:00,MSFT,Game On (Your Phone): T-Mobile and Microsoft Team Up on Project xCloud Game Streaming,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/game-on-your-phone-tmobile-and-microsoft-team-up-20190924.jpg,businesswire.com,"BELLEVUE & REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Two major players, changing the gaming game. Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced a technical partnership to deliver the future of gaming in the U.S. with Project xCloud, beginning next month. The companies are working together to optimize the game streaming experience in the U.S. and learn more about the way gamers play games on mobile devices by streaming popular Xbox console titles over LTE. The deal combines Microsoft’s expertise in cloud and gaming with the strength and reach of T-Mobile’s LTE network today and vision for broad and deep 5G in the future. The public preview of Project xCloud will enable consumers to experience Xbox games streaming over LTE to a smartphone or tablet. “Mobile game streaming is the future and has the potential to unlock console-quality game play anywhere. I for one want to be at the forefront of that revolution driving it forward,” said Neville Ray, Chief Technology Officer at T-Mobile. “That’s why Microsoft chose T-Mobile and we answered … so T-Mobile customers can be some of the first to give this revolutionary service a try and to make sure our network is primed for the mobile game streaming future!” Project xCloud is Microsoft’s game streaming technology that empowers gamers to play console-quality games anywhere they are, on the mobile and tablet devices they already own. Microsoft’s approach to game streaming combines nearly 40 years of gaming experience with resources and investments from across the company, including Azure’s cloud footprint and an array of content from Xbox Game Studios. The technical partnership allows both companies to work together to better optimize the gaming experience for players in the U.S. Supported by T-Mobile’s newest, most powerful LTE signal, 600 MHz, cloud gaming will let gamers experience console-quality games on their smartphones and tablets from virtually anywhere they want to play. No signal goes farther or is more reliable. “We chose T-Mobile as our technical partner for the Project xCloud preview in the US to leverage their mobile expertise as we embark on the next phase of our cloud gaming journey,” said Kareem Choudhry, Corporate Vice President, Project xCloud. “T-Mobile’s strong network performance, excitement for gaming, and partnership will help us better understand how to meet the needs of gamers.” Starting in October, Microsoft will invite a limited number of players into the Project xCloud public preview to stream popular Xbox titles over T-Mobile’s advanced LTE network to their smartphones and tablets. Starting with Android, the preview will include Gears 5, Halo 5: Guardians, Sea of Thieves and Killer Instinct with more titles and devices coming over time. Microsoft will combine its expertise in gaming with the reach of T-Mobile’s advanced nationwide LTE network and extensive experience in streaming services to leverage learnings from the U.S. Project xCloud preview and ensure they are delivering the best game streaming experience to customers. The Un-carrier envisions a future of gaming that’s even more robust and immersive with broad and deep nationwide 5G from the New T-Mobile, if regulators approve the proposed merger with Sprint. While game streaming will work on today’s LTE networks, broad and deep nationwide 5G opens the future possibility for an enhanced gaming experience with cutting-edge game streaming technology such as augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. T-Mobile delivers network performance that’s neck-and-neck with competitors and now covers 326 million people with LTE — 99% of Americans. That’s all thanks to unprecedented investments in people and technology over the last three years, including adding one million square miles of new LTE coverage, adding more than 25,000 towers and cell sites, hiring more than 3,000 full time engineers and upgrading every single LTE cell site across the entirety of the network to deliver LTE-Advanced speeds and performance. To achieve these network enhancements, T-Mobile spent nearly $30 billion, with $7.99 billion dedicated to purchasing 600 MHz airwaves covering 100% of the U.S. — the company’s largest investment ever. Gamers can sign up for a chance to participate in the Project xCloud public preview at http://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-streaming. T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers will need an unlimited data plan, a smartphone or tablet running Android 6.0 or higher with Bluetooth 4.0; a Microsoft account; and a Bluetooth-enabled Xbox One Wireless Controller. For more information about T-Mobile’s network, visit www.t-mobile.com/coverage. On all T-Mobile plans, during congestion, the small fraction of customers using >50GB/mo. may notice reduced speeds until next bill cycle due to data prioritization. No signal is more reliable (traveling far and deep) than 600 MHz; capable device required, coverage not available in all areas.

MSCI（NYSE：MSCI）とマイクロソフトは、世界の投資業界でイノベーションを加速するための戦略的提携を結びました。マイクロソフトのクラウドおよびAI技術の力と、MSCIの投資判断支援ツールが持つ世界的影響力が結び付くことで、両社は業界で新たなイノベーションを解き放ち、資産運用会社、資産保有者、ヘッジファンド、銀行など、世界で最も高度な投資家の間でMSCIの顧客体験を強化します。 当初両社は、MSCIの既存の製品、データ、サービスを、優先的クラウド・プラットフォームとしてAzureに段階的に移行することに重点を置きます。まずはインデックスおよび分析ソリューション、続いて環境・社会・ガバナンス（ESG）製品および格付け、不動産データおよびソリューション、MSCIのリスク分析プラットフォームのBeonを移行させます。MSCIのデータ・分析サービスとインフラストラクチャーが最新化されることで、両社は、投資家がデータをより迅速かつ効率的に管理し、リスクとパフォーマンスの推進要因を理解する上で役立つ新たな能力を提供できるようになります。 さらに、MSCIとマイクロソフトは、マイクロソフトのAzureおよびPower PlatformとMSCIのESGおよび気候ソリューションの能力を活用し、気候変動リスクとESGソリューションを推進する協業の機会を模索します。この将来の協業は、持続可能性に対する両社の取り組みに沿ったもので、投資家は気候変動がもたらすビジネス・リスクと機会をより適切に理解して解釈できるようになります。 MSCIのヘンリー・フェルナンデス会長兼最高経営責任者（CEO）は、次のように述べています。「戦略とビジネスモデルの進化に伴ってイノベーションと適応を迅速に行い、ビッグデータを構築して管理し、運用効率を向上させる投資家のニーズは、世界で極めて急速に高まっています。マイクロソフトとの戦略的提携は、製品とサービスのテクノロジーで絶え間ないイノベーションを推進し、投資家が希望する投資成果を達成できるようにするというMSCIの取り組みを強化するものです。」

マイクロソフトのクラウド＋AI担当エグゼクティブ・バイスプレジデントのスコット・ガスリー氏は、次のように述べています。「投資家は、インテリジェントな知見の提供、リスクの管理、異常の検出を可能にする最先端のテクノロジーを活用し、顧客の投資目標達成を支援できるようにしています。アジュールとそのAI機能の力を、MSCIの専門知識と投資エコシステムでの立場と合わせて活用することで、投資家が顧客のパフォーマンス能力をさらに最適化する上で役立つ新しいイノベーションを加速させることができます。」 マイクロソフトのアジュール・アプリおよびインフラ担当バイスプレジデントのメリー・ウィリアムソン氏は、次のように述べています。「両社の提携により、世界の投資業界にとって刺激的な未開拓分野が開かれます。MSCIの絶え間ないイノベーションの追求とマイクロソフトの深いデータ専門知識、広範なパートナー・エコシステム、市場開拓機能が統合されることで、投資業界を加速させる可能性を有する提携が生まれます。」
