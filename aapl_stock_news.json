The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Apple common stock between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). The case, City of Roseville Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 19-cv-2033 was filed on April 16, 2019. The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple\u2019s pricing power in greater China; (2) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company\u2019s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple\u2019s iPhone sales growth; (3) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (4) defendants\u2019 decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company\u2019s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company\u2019s flagship product. On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that, for the first time in 15 years, Apple would miss its prior quarterly revenue forecast amid falling iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market after the United States and Europe. The Company announced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of only $84 billion, far below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018. The Company also admitted that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company\u2019s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales. On this news, the Company's stock price fell from $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019\u2014a $15.62 or 9.96% drop.

International sales accounted for 61 percent of the quarter\u2019s revenue. \u201cOur March quarter results show the continued strength of our installed base of over 1.4 billion active devices, as we set an all-time record for Services, and the strong momentum of our Wearables, Home and Accessories category, which set a new March quarter record,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe delivered our strongest iPad growth in six years, and we are as excited as ever about our pipeline of innovative hardware, software and services.

        "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today announced a new repair program, offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone\u00ae repairs. Apple will provide more independent repair businesses \u2014 large or small \u2014 with the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics as its Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs). The program is launching in the US with plans to expand to other countries. \u201cTo better meet our customers\u2019 needs, we\u2019re making it easier for independent providers across the US to tap into the same resources as our Apple Authorized Service Provider network,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWhen a repair is needed, a customer should have confidence the repair is done right. We believe the safest and most reliable repair is one handled by a trained technician using genuine parts that have been properly engineered and rigorously tested.\u201d The new independent repair provider program complements Apple\u2019s continued investment in its growing global network of over 5,000 AASPs that lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in- and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products. There is no cost to join Apple\u2019s independent repair program. To qualify for the new program, businesses need to have an Apple-certified technician who can perform the repairs. The process for certification is simple and free of charge. To learn more and apply, visit support.apple.com/irp-program. Qualifying repair businesses will receive Apple-genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics at the same cost as AASPs. Over the past year, Apple has launched a successful pilot with 20 independent repair businesses in North America, Europe and Asia who are currently offering genuine parts for repairs. Today\u2019s announcement follows Apple\u2019s recent major expansion of its authorized service network into every Best Buy store in the US, tripling the number of US AASP locations compared to three years ago. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s four software platforms \u2014 iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.
