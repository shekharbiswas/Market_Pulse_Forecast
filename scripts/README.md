4. **Data Preprocessing, Sequence Creation & Splitting for LSTM**  
   The dataset is loaded, and the `publishedDate` is converted to a `datetime` format. The data is then aggregated by date, calculating average sentiment scores and stock price statistics. Numeric columns are normalized for uniform scaling. Sequences of 30 consecutive days are created as input features (X) for the LSTM model, with the target variable (y) being the closing price for the next day. The data is split into training, validation, and test sets while preserving the chronological order, ensuring realistic model evaluation. The prepared datasets are then saved for model training.
