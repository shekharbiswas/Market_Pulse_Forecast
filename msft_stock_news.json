        "text": "BELLEVUE & REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Two major players, changing the gaming game. Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced a technical partnership to deliver the future of gaming in the U.S. with Project xCloud, beginning next month. The companies are working together to optimize the game streaming experience in the U.S. and learn more about the way gamers play games on mobile devices by streaming popular Xbox console titles over LTE. The deal combines Microsoft\u2019s expertise in cloud and gaming with the strength and reach of T-Mobile\u2019s LTE network today and vision for broad and deep 5G in the future. The public preview of Project xCloud will enable consumers to experience Xbox games streaming over LTE to a smartphone or tablet. \u201cMobile game streaming is the future and has the potential to unlock console-quality game play anywhere. I for one want to be at the forefront of that revolution driving it forward,\u201d said Neville Ray, Chief Technology Officer at T-Mobile. \u201cThat\u2019s why Microsoft chose T-Mobile and we answered \u2026 so T-Mobile customers can be some of the first to give this revolutionary service a try and to make sure our network is primed for the mobile game streaming future!\u201d Project xCloud is Microsoft\u2019s game streaming technology that empowers gamers to play console-quality games anywhere they are, on the mobile and tablet devices they already own. Microsoft\u2019s approach to game streaming combines nearly 40 years of gaming experience with resources and investments from across the company, including Azure\u2019s cloud footprint and an array of content from Xbox Game Studios. The technical partnership allows both companies to work together to better optimize the gaming experience for players in the U.S. Supported by T-Mobile\u2019s newest, most powerful LTE signal, 600 MHz, cloud gaming will let gamers experience console-quality games on their smartphones and tablets from virtually anywhere they want to play. No signal goes farther or is more reliable. \u201cWe chose T-Mobile as our technical partner for the Project xCloud preview in the US to leverage their mobile expertise as we embark on the next phase of our cloud gaming journey,\u201d said Kareem Choudhry, Corporate Vice President, Project xCloud. \u201cT-Mobile\u2019s strong network performance, excitement for gaming, and partnership will help us better understand how to meet the needs of gamers.\u201d Starting in October, Microsoft will invite a limited number of players into the Project xCloud public preview to stream popular Xbox titles over T-Mobile\u2019s advanced LTE network to their smartphones and tablets. Starting with Android, the preview will include Gears 5, Halo 5: Guardians, Sea of Thieves and Killer Instinct with more titles and devices coming over time. Microsoft will combine its expertise in gaming with the reach of T-Mobile\u2019s advanced nationwide LTE network and extensive experience in streaming services to leverage learnings from the U.S. Project xCloud preview and ensure they are delivering the best game streaming experience to customers. The Un-carrier envisions a future of gaming that\u2019s even more robust and immersive with broad and deep nationwide 5G from the New T-Mobile, if regulators approve the proposed merger with Sprint. While game streaming will work on today\u2019s LTE networks, broad and deep nationwide 5G opens the future possibility for an enhanced gaming experience with cutting-edge game streaming technology such as augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. T-Mobile delivers network performance that\u2019s neck-and-neck with competitors and now covers 326 million people with LTE \u2014 99% of Americans. That\u2019s all thanks to unprecedented investments in people and technology over the last three years, including adding one million square miles of new LTE coverage, adding more than 25,000 towers and cell sites, hiring more than 3,000 full time engineers and upgrading every single LTE cell site across the entirety of the network to deliver LTE-Advanced speeds and performance. To achieve these network enhancements, T-Mobile spent nearly $30 billion, with $7.99 billion dedicated to purchasing 600 MHz airwaves covering 100% of the U.S. \u2014 the company\u2019s largest investment ever. Gamers can sign up for a chance to participate in the Project xCloud public preview at http://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-streaming. T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers will need an unlimited data plan, a smartphone or tablet running Android 6.0 or higher with Bluetooth 4.0; a Microsoft account; and a Bluetooth-enabled Xbox One Wireless Controller. For more information about T-Mobile\u2019s network, visit www.t-mobile.com/coverage. On all T-Mobile plans, during congestion, the small fraction of customers using >50GB/mo. may notice reduced speeds until next bill cycle due to data prioritization. No signal is more reliable (traveling far and deep) than 600 MHz; capable device required, coverage not available in all areas.
