The case, City of Roseville Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 19-cv-2033 was filed on April 16, 2019. The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple\u2019s pricing power in greater China; (2) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company\u2019s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple\u2019s iPhone sales growth; (3) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (4) defendants\u2019 decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company\u2019s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company\u2019s flagship product. On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that, for the first time in 15 years, Apple would miss its prior quarterly revenue forecast amid falling iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market after the United States and Europe. The Company announced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of only $84 billion, far below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018. The Company also admitted that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company\u2019s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales. On this news, the Company's stock price fell from $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019\u2014a $15.62 or 9.96% drop.

International sales accounted for 61 percent of the quarter\u2019s revenue. \u201cOur March quarter results show the continued strength of our installed base of over 1.4 billion active devices, as we set an all-time record for Services, and the strong momentum of our Wearables, Home and Accessories category, which set a new March quarter record,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe delivered our strongest iPad growth in six years, and we are as excited as ever about our pipeline of innovative hardware, software and services.

        "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today announced a new repair program, offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone\u00ae repairs. Apple will provide more independent repair businesses \u2014 large or small \u2014 with the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics as its Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs). The program is launching in the US with plans to expand to other countries. \u201cTo better meet our customers\u2019 needs, we\u2019re making it easier for independent providers across the US to tap into the same resources as our Apple Authorized Service Provider network,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWhen a repair is needed, a customer should have confidence the repair is done right. We believe the safest and most reliable repair is one handled by a trained technician using genuine parts that have been properly engineered and rigorously tested.\u201d The new independent repair provider program complements Apple\u2019s continued investment in its growing global network of over 5,000 AASPs that lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in- and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products. There is no cost to join Apple\u2019s independent repair program. To qualify for the new program, businesses need to have an Apple-certified technician who can perform the repairs. The process for certification is simple and free of charge. To learn more and apply, visit support.apple.com/irp-program. Qualifying repair businesses will receive Apple-genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics at the same cost as AASPs. Over the past year, Apple has launched a successful pilot with 20 independent repair businesses in North America, Europe and Asia who are currently offering genuine parts for repairs. Today\u2019s announcement follows Apple\u2019s recent major expansion of its authorized service network into every Best Buy store in the US, tripling the number of US AASP locations compared to three years ago. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s four software platforms \u2014 iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

Free for all developers, WWDC21 will offer unique insight into the future of iOS, iPadOS\u00ae, macOS\u00ae, watchOS\u00ae, and tvOS\u00ae. Building on the record-breaking participation and learnings from last year\u2019s online conference, WWDC21 is an opportunity for developers to learn about the new technologies, tools, and frameworks they rely on to build innovative and platform-differentiating apps and games. Apple also announced that this year\u2019s Swift\u00ae Student Challenge, an opportunity for young developers to demonstrate their coding skills by creating a Swift playground, is now accepting submissions. \u201cWe love bringing our developers together each year at WWDC to learn about our latest technologies and to connect them with Apple engineers,\u201d said Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise and Education Marketing. \u201cWe are working to make WWDC21 our biggest and best yet, and are excited to offer Apple developers new tools to support them as they create apps that change the way we live, work, and play.\u201d As customers rely on Apple products more than ever to work, learn, express their creativity, entertain, and be entertained, WWDC21 will provide Apple\u2019s worldwide community of more than 28 million developers, as well as the next generation of app developers, with the information and tools needed to turn their ideas into reality. This year\u2019s conference will include announcements from the keynote and State of the Union stages, online sessions, 1:1 labs offering technical guidance, and new ways for developers to interact with Apple engineers and designers to learn about the latest frameworks and technologies. Apple will continue its long-standing tradition of supporting students who love to code with this year\u2019s Swift Student Challenge, inviting them to create an interactive scene in a Swift playground that can be experienced within three minutes. Swift Playgrounds\u00ae is a revolutionary app for iPad\u00ae and Mac\u00ae that makes learning the Swift programming language interactive and fun. Now through April 18, students can submit their Swift playground to the Swift Student Challenge. Winners will receive exclusive WWDC21 outerwear and a customized pin set. For more information, visit the Swift Student Challenge website. To support the local economy, even while WWDC21 is hosted online and as part of its $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, Apple is also committing $1 million to SJ Aspires, an education and equity initiative launched by the City of San Jos\u00e9. Focused on enabling youth in underserved neighborhoods to set goals and chart a path toward receiving a college education, SJ Aspires offers a performance-based scholarship program that educates students about their college and career choices, and provides individual mentorship and advising as well as online tools to help reduce the barriers Black and Brown students face in accessing academic opportunities. This builds on Apple\u2019s multiyear partnership with the City of San Jos\u00e9 and the San Jos\u00e9 Public Library Foundation in support of technology programming. Apple will share additional program information in advance of WWDC21 through the Apple Developer app, on the Apple Developer website, and via email. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud.

I personally can\u2019t wait for people to have a lot of fun experimenting and coming up with different versions of my song.\u201d Lady Gaga, artist: \u201cGarageBand is my idea bank and where I start my songwriting, so I\u2019m excited to make my song \u2018Free Woman\u2019 available as a Remix Session. I want musicians and music lovers to be able to see how a song is produced and be able to hear all the individual parts, and then put their own creative color on it, doing whatever they want in GarageBand.\u201d Creative Inspiration from Today\u2019s Biggest Hitmakers Musicians can now create their own songs with help from some of today\u2019s biggest music producers, using seven new downloadable Producer Packs created for GarageBand by Boys Noize, Mark Lettieri, Oak Felder, Soulection, Take A Daytrip, Tom Misch, and TRAKGIRL. Each Producer Pack is bursting with hundreds of royalty-free loops, beats, instruments, drum kits, synth patches, and samples that embody the sound and vibe of each producer. And in-app videos feature each producer offering words of encouragement to beginners, as well as insights into their creative process. Oak Felder, producer (Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato, John Legend): \u201cWhenever someone asks me how to start producing and making beats, I tell them to grab their iPhone and open up GarageBand. It removes all the technical obstacles and makes it easy to turn a simple musical idea into something great. I still use GarageBand to sketch out ideas, so it\u2019s especially cool to be able to deliver my own selection of royalty-free sounds to help someone else write their own hit song.\u201d David Biral and Denzel Baptiste, Take A Daytrip, producers (Lil Nas X, Kid Cudi, Travis Scott): \u201cWe both got our start using GarageBand, met to form Take A Daytrip, and added Logic Pro to our production tools. Our new Producer Pack is a personal collection of signature sounds created from our favorite synths and gear so that we could always have access to them whenever we\u2019re away from our studio. Our goal is always to make technology more accessible for the next generation of producers and artists. Making our own sounds for GarageBand is a perfect way to pay forward the inspiration we got from previous generations of creators.\u201d TRAKGIRL, producer (Andra Day, Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, Vic Mensa): \u201cIt\u2019s been an important mission of mine to help young women break into music making, and GarageBand is a powerful creative tool that everyone has access to. I hope my Producer Pack will inspire people globally to embrace their creativity and show that anyone can follow their dreams and get involved in music production.\u201d Companion Experience for \u201cWatch the Sound With Mark Ronson\u201d In the new Apple Original docuseries \u201cWatch the Sound With Mark Ronson,\u201d Oscar- and Grammy Award-winning producer-artist Mark Ronson explores the intersection of technology and musical innovation. With the exclusive \u201cWatch the Sound With Mark Ronson\u201d Producer Pack in GarageBand, users can extend the viewing experience by getting hands-on time with GarageBand versions of the music technology featured in every episode, from sampling to drum machines, synths to reverb, and vocal effects to distortion. Mark Ronson, artist and producer (Adele, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga): \u201cOur new series, \u2018Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,\u2019 explores and celebrates the intersection of music and technology, and it is exciting to have GarageBand bring the beats and sounds from the show to anyone who is inspired to create their own songs. This Producer Pack delivers the creativity and excitement of the show in a way I never imagined and couldn\u2019t be more excited about.\u201d Availability All-new Remix Sessions and Producer Packs are available today as a free download from the Sound Library in GarageBand 2.3.11, the latest version of the app, for iOS and iPadOS.

        "site": "businesswire.com",
        "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today announced that it is working with several states across the country, which will roll out the ability for their residents to seamlessly and securely add their driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet on their iPhone\u00ae and Apple Watch\u00ae. Arizona and Georgia will be the first states to introduce this new innovation to their residents, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah to follow. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enable select airport security checkpoints and lanes in participating airports as the first locations customers can use their driver\u2019s license or state ID in Wallet. Built with privacy at the forefront, Wallet provides a more secure and convenient way for customers to present their driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs on iPhone or Apple Watch. \u201cThe addition of driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs to Apple Wallet is an important step in our vision of replacing the physical wallet with a secure and easy-to-use mobile wallet,\u201d said Jennifer Bailey, Apple\u2019s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. \u201cWe are excited that the TSA and so many states are already on board to help bring this to life for travelers across the country using only their iPhone and Apple Watch, and we are already in discussions with many more states as we\u2019re working to offer this nationwide in the future.\u201d \u201cThis new and innovative mobile driver\u2019s license and state ID initiative with Apple and states around the country will enable a more seamless airport security screening experience for travelers,\u201d said David Pekoske, TSA Administrator. \u201cThis initiative marks a major milestone by TSA to provide an additional level of convenience for the traveler by enabling more opportunities for touchless TSA airport security screening.\u201d Seamless and Secure Experience Driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet will provide an easy, fast, and more secure way for people to present their driver\u2019s license or state ID using their iPhone or Apple Watch. Once a participating state begins offering this capability to its residents, customers will be able to add their driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet and simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to present it to the TSA, without taking out their physical card or handing over their device. Adding a driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet: Similar to how customers add new credit cards and transit passes to Wallet today, they can simply tap the + button at the top of the screen in Wallet on their iPhone to begin adding their license or ID. If the user has an Apple Watch paired to their iPhone, they will be prompted to also add their ID or driver\u2019s license to their Wallet app on their Apple Watch. The customer will then be asked to use their iPhone to scan their physical driver\u2019s license or state ID card and take a selfie, which will be securely provided to the issuing state for verification. As an additional security step, users will also be prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process. Once verified by the issuing state, the customer\u2019s ID or driver\u2019s license will be added to Wallet. Presenting a driver\u2019s license or state ID to TSA: Once added to Wallet, customers can present their driver\u2019s license or state ID to the TSA by simply tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch at the identity reader. Upon tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch, customers will see a prompt on their device displaying the specific information being requested by the TSA. Only after authorizing with Face ID\u00ae or Touch ID\u00ae is the requested identity information released from their device, which ensures that just the required information is shared and only the person who added the driver\u2019s license or state ID to the device can present it. Users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to present their ID. Security and Privacy Wallet provides a convenient and more secure way to present driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs, while offering superior security and privacy over a physical wallet. Apple and the issuing states do not know when or where users present their IDs. Driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet take full advantage of the privacy and security built into iPhone and Apple Watch. Customers\u2019 identity data is encrypted and protected against tampering and theft. Biometric authentication using Face ID and Touch ID ensures that only the person who added the ID to the device can view or present their ID or license in Wallet. Driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet are only presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between the device and the identity reader, so users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device. If a user misplaces their iPhone or Apple Watch, they can use the Find My\u2122 app to lock their device and help locate it, or remotely erase a device. Apple\u2019s mobile ID implementation supports the ISO 18013-5 mDL (mobile driver\u2019s license) standard which Apple has played an active role in the development of, and which sets clear guidelines for the industry around protecting consumers\u2019 privacy when presenting an ID or driver\u2019s license through a mobile device. States Across the Country See Benefits of IDs in Wallet States across the country are looking forward to the superior security and convenience that driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet provide to them and their users. \u201cArizona is at the leading edge of states making mobile IDs available to the public, and we are pleased to work with Apple and give Arizonans the choice, convenience, and security of adding their driver\u2019s license to their Apple Wallet,\u201d said Eric Jorgensen, director of the Arizona Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Division. \u201cBeyond being innovative and exciting, a digital version of a driver\u2019s license offers increased security and privacy for our residents, making it something everyone should consider.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring a new addition to our state\u2019s modernization efforts that will make our residents\u2019 lives easier, and keep their identities secure through the use of mobile driver\u2019s licenses in Apple Wallet,\u201d said Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to be one of the first states working with Apple to deploy driver\u2019s licenses and state identification cards in Apple Wallet, and we\u2019re looking forward to taking the next steps to make sure this new feature benefits our residents.\u201d \u201cGeorgia is a national leader when it comes to the safety and security of its driver and identity credentialing process, with more than 99 percent of Georgians REAL ID compliant, and the state of Georgia is equally as committed to safety and security through our mobile driver\u2019s licensing (mDL) efforts with Apple,\u201d said Spencer R. Moore, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Driver Services. \u201cTogether, we will deliver customer convenience through touchless identity verification and enhanced security and privacy protection through technology. We are honored to work with Apple as an initial adopter for such a revolutionary customer experience. A state-issued credential has become the standard for which institutions of all sectors use as a trusted source of identity proofing. The identity proofing bar has been raised significantly thanks to Apple and innovative states like Georgia.\u201d \u201cWe are glad to see Apple advance the acceptance of mobile driver\u2019s licenses by offering a secure and convenient way to present a mobile driver\u2019s license with Apple Wallet,\u201d said Melissa Gillett, director of the Iowa Motor Vehicle Division. \u201cPrivacy and security have been at the forefront of our mobile driver\u2019s license development process and we appreciate Apple\u2019s proven reputation in these areas, as well as the shared commitment to following the ISO 18013-5 standard.\u201d \u201cThe Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is excited to be leading the pack through this innovative collaboration with Apple to further deliver on our pledge to take driver licensing to the next level,\u201d said Matt Cole, commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Vehicle Regulation. \u201cThe potential for mobile driver\u2019s licenses is limitless, and we look forward to taking steps to continue to offer modern conveniences to Kentuckians while maintaining our unwavering commitment to security and privacy.\u201d \u201cMaryland is proud to be a leader once again in safe innovation with the implementation of mobile driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d said Maryland Governor Larry Hogan. \u201cAs we look to the future, we are committed to enhancing convenience and accessibility while maintaining the highest safety and security standards for our state and citizens.\u201d \u201cWe are excited to work with Apple on mobile IDs in Apple Wallet. This innovative project is yet another example of the momentum we are building as a state in our continued efforts to be a national leader in the digital transformation space,\u201d said Jerry Moore, CIO of the state of Oklahoma. \u201cUtah has always been a forward-looking state. We regularly hear from people who want to access their driver license through their phones,\u201d said Jess Anderson, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for Utah to work with Apple in an innovative use of technology. This secure mobile license adds convenience while helping keep Utah safe.\u201d Participating states and the TSA will share more information at a later date about when support for mobile driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet will be available in each state, and which TSA airport security checkpoints and select lanes it will be available at first.

And Numbers\u00ae introduces pivot tables that bring powerful data analytics capabilities to iPhone, iPad\u00ae, and Mac\u00ae. \u201cWhether they are in the office, at school, or working remotely, users around the world love Keynote, Pages, and Numbers for their powerful features, ease of use, and seamless experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac,\u201d said Bob Borchers, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \u201cToday, we\u2019re adding even more power and capability to these apps with new productivity and collaboration features that enable anyone to create more personal and compelling presentations, make working with documents on iPhone a breeze, and bring full-featured pivot tables to mobile for the first time.\u201d New Ways to Present in Keynote Powerful new tools make Keynote presentations more personal, engaging, and collaborative. With the option to use the front-facing camera on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, users can now add live video directly to their presentations. This allows the presenter to appear alongside the content in their slide \u2014 ideal for lectures, how-to videos, and remote presentations through video conferencing apps. Live video objects can be easily resized or styled with masks, frames, drop shadows, and reflections for a more elegant look. Mac users can connect multiple external cameras to further enhance the live video experience, and they can even show the screen of a connected iPhone or iPad right on a slide for live, interactive demos. With a new multi-presenter option, everyone can now easily control a shared slideshow right from their iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Whether they are in the same room or presenting remotely, multiple users can take turns advancing slides. Once a user is done with their slides, they can return control to the host or let another co-presenter take over to seamlessly continue the group presentation. A New Pages Experience Optimized for iPhone People read Pages documents on iPhone more than any other device, and Pages now offers a new experience that makes reading and editing documents on the go better than ever. With the latest update, Screen View automatically displays text, images, and other elements in a single-column, continuous flow optimized for the iPhone screen. Text is enlarged to improve readability, photos and drawings are sized to fit the display, and tables can be scrolled horizontally. Screen View is available for all word processing documents and doesn\u2019t require any additional setup. When enabled, users still have access to the complete set of editing tools in Pages. And Screen View can be switched off at any time so users can see the page layout for their document before printing or publishing. Powerful, Easy-to-Use Pivot Tables with Numbers With its intuitive interface and ability to showcase data with beautiful graphics and charts, Numbers has always been the best way for users to get the most out of their data. And now with pivot tables, users can quickly summarize, group, and rearrange data to identify and analyze patterns and trends. Creating a pivot table in Numbers is quick and intuitive: Users can easily select the data to include, choose how to group and summarize it, and access other display options from the sidebar. The resulting pivot table appears in a clear layout that makes it easy for the user to read and gain insights. Users can visualize their pivot tables with insightful charts, share pivot data with others while keeping the source data private, and even import or export pivot tables to and from Microsoft Excel. Numbers is the first app to bring full-featured pivot tables to mobile, with the same set of features across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, giving users access to this powerful data analytics tool wherever they work. Additionally, Radar charts are a new chart type that makes it easy to visually compare multiple variables with similarities shown as overlapping areas, allowing differences and outliers to really stand out. And new filter options let users find duplicate entries and unique values in their data, or easily show or hide rows that match a specific value. Keynote, Pages, and Numbers also support the new translation features introduced in iOS 15, iPadOS\u00ae 15, and macOS\u00ae Monterey. Users can select text and quickly see a translation, hear it read aloud, and instantly replace the selection with the translated text. Availability Keynote, Pages, and Numbers come free on every new iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Today\u2019s updates are available to download on the App Store\u00ae and Mac App Store. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.
