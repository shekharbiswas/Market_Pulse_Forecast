The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Apple common stock between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). The case, City of Roseville Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 19-cv-2033 was filed on April 16, 2019. The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple\u2019s pricing power in greater China; (2) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company\u2019s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple\u2019s iPhone sales growth; (3) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (4) defendants\u2019 decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company\u2019s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company\u2019s flagship product. On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that, for the first time in 15 years, Apple would miss its prior quarterly revenue forecast amid falling iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market after the United States and Europe. The Company announced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of only $84 billion, far below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018. The Company also admitted that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company\u2019s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales. On this news, the Company's stock price fell from $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019\u2014a $15.62 or 9.96% drop.

        "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today announced a new repair program, offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone\u00ae repairs. Apple will provide more independent repair businesses \u2014 large or small \u2014 with the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics as its Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs). The program is launching in the US with plans to expand to other countries. \u201cTo better meet our customers\u2019 needs, we\u2019re making it easier for independent providers across the US to tap into the same resources as our Apple Authorized Service Provider network,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWhen a repair is needed, a customer should have confidence the repair is done right. We believe the safest and most reliable repair is one handled by a trained technician using genuine parts that have been properly engineered and rigorously tested.\u201d The new independent repair provider program complements Apple\u2019s continued investment in its growing global network of over 5,000 AASPs that lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in- and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products. There is no cost to join Apple\u2019s independent repair program. To qualify for the new program, businesses need to have an Apple-certified technician who can perform the repairs. The process for certification is simple and free of charge. To learn more and apply, visit support.apple.com/irp-program. Qualifying repair businesses will receive Apple-genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics at the same cost as AASPs. Over the past year, Apple has launched a successful pilot with 20 independent repair businesses in North America, Europe and Asia who are currently offering genuine parts for repairs. Today\u2019s announcement follows Apple\u2019s recent major expansion of its authorized service network into every Best Buy store in the US, tripling the number of US AASP locations compared to three years ago. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s four software platforms \u2014 iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

Free for all developers, WWDC21 will offer unique insight into the future of iOS, iPadOS\u00ae, macOS\u00ae, watchOS\u00ae, and tvOS\u00ae. Building on the record-breaking participation and learnings from last year\u2019s online conference, WWDC21 is an opportunity for developers to learn about the new technologies, tools, and frameworks they rely on to build innovative and platform-differentiating apps and games. Apple also announced that this year\u2019s Swift\u00ae Student Challenge, an opportunity for young developers to demonstrate their coding skills by creating a Swift playground, is now accepting submissions. \u201cWe love bringing our developers together each year at WWDC to learn about our latest technologies and to connect them with Apple engineers,\u201d said Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise and Education Marketing. \u201cWe are working to make WWDC21 our biggest and best yet, and are excited to offer Apple developers new tools to support them as they create apps that change the way we live, work, and play.\u201d As customers rely on Apple products more than ever to work, learn, express their creativity, entertain, and be entertained, WWDC21 will provide Apple\u2019s worldwide community of more than 28 million developers, as well as the next generation of app developers, with the information and tools needed to turn their ideas into reality. This year\u2019s conference will include announcements from the keynote and State of the Union stages, online sessions, 1:1 labs offering technical guidance, and new ways for developers to interact with Apple engineers and designers to learn about the latest frameworks and technologies. Apple will continue its long-standing tradition of supporting students who love to code with this year\u2019s Swift Student Challenge, inviting them to create an interactive scene in a Swift playground that can be experienced within three minutes. Swift Playgrounds\u00ae is a revolutionary app for iPad\u00ae and Mac\u00ae that makes learning the Swift programming language interactive and fun. Now through April 18, students can submit their Swift playground to the Swift Student Challenge. Winners will receive exclusive WWDC21 outerwear and a customized pin set. For more information, visit the Swift Student Challenge website. To support the local economy, even while WWDC21 is hosted online and as part of its $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, Apple is also committing $1 million to SJ Aspires, an education and equity initiative launched by the City of San Jos\u00e9. Focused on enabling youth in underserved neighborhoods to set goals and chart a path toward receiving a college education, SJ Aspires offers a performance-based scholarship program that educates students about their college and career choices, and provides individual mentorship and advising as well as online tools to help reduce the barriers Black and Brown students face in accessing academic opportunities. This builds on Apple\u2019s multiyear partnership with the City of San Jos\u00e9 and the San Jos\u00e9 Public Library Foundation in support of technology programming. Apple will share additional program information in advance of WWDC21 through the Apple Developer app, on the Apple Developer website, and via email. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud.

An additional Producer Pack provides a special companion experience to the new Apple Original docuseries \u201cWatch the Sound With Mark Ronson,\u201d premiering Friday, July 30, on Apple TV+\u2120, enabling viewers to experiment with sounds inspired by the music featured in the show. \u201cGarageBand continues to be a catalyst for music creation \u2014 making it easy for novices to get started and for seasoned pros to develop their ideas on the go,\u201d said Bob Borchers, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \u201cFor this update, we\u2019ve collaborated with an incredible group of artists and producers to give musicians an amazing collection of new sounds to play with, and we hope even more people will be inspired to tap into their creativity and start making music in GarageBand.\u201d Art of the Remix with Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga Anyone can now develop their remix skills in GarageBand with two new in-app Remix Sessions featuring Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga. Each session includes inspirational videos from each artist telling the stories behind their hit songs \u201cBreak My Heart\u201d (Dua Lipa) and \u201cFree Woman\u201d (Lady Gaga), as well as step-by-step remix instructions led by an Apple Retail Creative Pro using a GarageBand Live Loops version of each song. During these sessions, anyone can interact with these hits just as an artist would in the studio, hearing isolated vocals, beats, and individual instruments that provide the foundational elements of a song. With touch instruments and thousands of Apple Loops available in GarageBand, users can let their creativity run wild, taking their remix in any direction from Hip Hop to EDM, or any combination of sounds they dream up. Fun and easy for any level, these Remix Sessions expand on Apple\u2019s popular Today at Apple\u00ae educational sessions that take place in Apple Store\u00ae locations around the world. Previous Today at Apple in-store Music Labs have featured top artists including Alicia Keys, Billie Eilish, Khalid, Madonna, Pu Shu, and Taylor Swift. Dua Lipa, artist: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see Apple bringing my music to life in GarageBand, so now anyone can experience how I made \u2018Break My Heart\u2019 no matter where they are. Music has the power to bring people together, and this is doing that in such an exciting way. I personally can\u2019t wait for people to have a lot of fun experimenting and coming up with different versions of my song.\u201d Lady Gaga, artist: \u201cGarageBand is my idea bank and where I start my songwriting, so I\u2019m excited to make my song \u2018Free Woman\u2019 available as a Remix Session. I want musicians and music lovers to be able to see how a song is produced and be able to hear all the individual parts, and then put their own creative color on it, doing whatever they want in GarageBand.\u201d Creative Inspiration from Today\u2019s Biggest Hitmakers Musicians can now create their own songs with help from some of today\u2019s biggest music producers, using seven new downloadable Producer Packs created for GarageBand by Boys Noize, Mark Lettieri, Oak Felder, Soulection, Take A Daytrip, Tom Misch, and TRAKGIRL. Each Producer Pack is bursting with hundreds of royalty-free loops, beats, instruments, drum kits, synth patches, and samples that embody the sound and vibe of each producer. And in-app videos feature each producer offering words of encouragement to beginners, as well as insights into their creative process. Oak Felder, producer (Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato, John Legend): \u201cWhenever someone asks me how to start producing and making beats, I tell them to grab their iPhone and open up GarageBand. It removes all the technical obstacles and makes it easy to turn a simple musical idea into something great. I still use GarageBand to sketch out ideas, so it\u2019s especially cool to be able to deliver my own selection of royalty-free sounds to help someone else write their own hit song.\u201d David Biral and Denzel Baptiste, Take A Daytrip, producers (Lil Nas X, Kid Cudi, Travis Scott): \u201cWe both got our start using GarageBand, met to form Take A Daytrip, and added Logic Pro to our production tools. Our new Producer Pack is a personal collection of signature sounds created from our favorite synths and gear so that we could always have access to them whenever we\u2019re away from our studio. Our goal is always to make technology more accessible for the next generation of producers and artists. Making our own sounds for GarageBand is a perfect way to pay forward the inspiration we got from previous generations of creators.\u201d TRAKGIRL, producer (Andra Day, Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, Vic Mensa): \u201cIt\u2019s been an important mission of mine to help young women break into music making, and GarageBand is a powerful creative tool that everyone has access to. I hope my Producer Pack will inspire people globally to embrace their creativity and show that anyone can follow their dreams and get involved in music production.\u201d Companion Experience for \u201cWatch the Sound With Mark Ronson\u201d In the new Apple Original docuseries \u201cWatch the Sound With Mark Ronson,\u201d Oscar- and Grammy Award-winning producer-artist Mark Ronson explores the intersection of technology and musical innovation. With the exclusive \u201cWatch the Sound With Mark Ronson\u201d Producer Pack in GarageBand, users can extend the viewing experience by getting hands-on time with GarageBand versions of the music technology featured in every episode, from sampling to drum machines, synths to reverb, and vocal effects to distortion. Mark Ronson, artist and producer (Adele, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga): \u201cOur new series, \u2018Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,\u2019 explores and celebrates the intersection of music and technology, and it is exciting to have GarageBand bring the beats and sounds from the show to anyone who is inspired to create their own songs. This Producer Pack delivers the creativity and excitement of the show in a way I never imagined and couldn\u2019t be more excited about.\u201d Availability All-new Remix Sessions and Producer Packs are available today as a free download from the Sound Library in GarageBand 2.3.11, the latest version of the app, for iOS and iPadOS.

        "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/apple-announces-first-states-signed-up-to-adopt-drivers-licenses-20210901.jpg",
        "site": "businesswire.com",
        "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today announced that it is working with several states across the country, which will roll out the ability for their residents to seamlessly and securely add their driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet on their iPhone\u00ae and Apple Watch\u00ae. Arizona and Georgia will be the first states to introduce this new innovation to their residents, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah to follow. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enable select airport security checkpoints and lanes in participating airports as the first locations customers can use their driver\u2019s license or state ID in Wallet. Built with privacy at the forefront, Wallet provides a more secure and convenient way for customers to present their driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs on iPhone or Apple Watch. \u201cThe addition of driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs to Apple Wallet is an important step in our vision of replacing the physical wallet with a secure and easy-to-use mobile wallet,\u201d said Jennifer Bailey, Apple\u2019s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. \u201cWe are excited that the TSA and so many states are already on board to help bring this to life for travelers across the country using only their iPhone and Apple Watch, and we are already in discussions with many more states as we\u2019re working to offer this nationwide in the future.\u201d \u201cThis new and innovative mobile driver\u2019s license and state ID initiative with Apple and states around the country will enable a more seamless airport security screening experience for travelers,\u201d said David Pekoske, TSA Administrator. \u201cThis initiative marks a major milestone by TSA to provide an additional level of convenience for the traveler by enabling more opportunities for touchless TSA airport security screening.\u201d Seamless and Secure Experience Driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet will provide an easy, fast, and more secure way for people to present their driver\u2019s license or state ID using their iPhone or Apple Watch. Once a participating state begins offering this capability to its residents, customers will be able to add their driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet and simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to present it to the TSA, without taking out their physical card or handing over their device. Adding a driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet: Similar to how customers add new credit cards and transit passes to Wallet today, they can simply tap the + button at the top of the screen in Wallet on their iPhone to begin adding their license or ID. If the user has an Apple Watch paired to their iPhone, they will be prompted to also add their ID or driver\u2019s license to their Wallet app on their Apple Watch. The customer will then be asked to use their iPhone to scan their physical driver\u2019s license or state ID card and take a selfie, which will be securely provided to the issuing state for verification. As an additional security step, users will also be prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process. Once verified by the issuing state, the customer\u2019s ID or driver\u2019s license will be added to Wallet. Presenting a driver\u2019s license or state ID to TSA: Once added to Wallet, customers can present their driver\u2019s license or state ID to the TSA by simply tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch at the identity reader. Upon tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch, customers will see a prompt on their device displaying the specific information being requested by the TSA. Only after authorizing with Face ID\u00ae or Touch ID\u00ae is the requested identity information released from their device, which ensures that just the required information is shared and only the person who added the driver\u2019s license or state ID to the device can present it. Users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to present their ID. Security and Privacy Wallet provides a convenient and more secure way to present driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs, while offering superior security and privacy over a physical wallet. Apple and the issuing states do not know when or where users present their IDs. Driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet take full advantage of the privacy and security built into iPhone and Apple Watch. Customers\u2019 identity data is encrypted and protected against tampering and theft. Biometric authentication using Face ID and Touch ID ensures that only the person who added the ID to the device can view or present their ID or license in Wallet. Driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet are only presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between the device and the identity reader, so users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device. If a user misplaces their iPhone or Apple Watch, they can use the Find My\u2122 app to lock their device and help locate it, or remotely erase a device. Apple\u2019s mobile ID implementation supports the ISO 18013-5 mDL (mobile driver\u2019s license) standard which Apple has played an active role in the development of, and which sets clear guidelines for the industry around protecting consumers\u2019 privacy when presenting an ID or driver\u2019s license through a mobile device. States Across the Country See Benefits of IDs in Wallet States across the country are looking forward to the superior security and convenience that driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet provide to them and their users. \u201cArizona is at the leading edge of states making mobile IDs available to the public, and we are pleased to work with Apple and give Arizonans the choice, convenience, and security of adding their driver\u2019s license to their Apple Wallet,\u201d said Eric Jorgensen, director of the Arizona Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Division. \u201cBeyond being innovative and exciting, a digital version of a driver\u2019s license offers increased security and privacy for our residents, making it something everyone should consider.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring a new addition to our state\u2019s modernization efforts that will make our residents\u2019 lives easier, and keep their identities secure through the use of mobile driver\u2019s licenses in Apple Wallet,\u201d said Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to be one of the first states working with Apple to deploy driver\u2019s licenses and state identification cards in Apple Wallet, and we\u2019re looking forward to taking the next steps to make sure this new feature benefits our residents.\u201d \u201cGeorgia is a national leader when it comes to the safety and security of its driver and identity credentialing process, with more than 99 percent of Georgians REAL ID compliant, and the state of Georgia is equally as committed to safety and security through our mobile driver\u2019s licensing (mDL) efforts with Apple,\u201d said Spencer R. Moore, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Driver Services. \u201cTogether, we will deliver customer convenience through touchless identity verification and enhanced security and privacy protection through technology. We are honored to work with Apple as an initial adopter for such a revolutionary customer experience. A state-issued credential has become the standard for which institutions of all sectors use as a trusted source of identity proofing. The identity proofing bar has been raised significantly thanks to Apple and innovative states like Georgia.\u201d \u201cWe are glad to see Apple advance the acceptance of mobile driver\u2019s licenses by offering a secure and convenient way to present a mobile driver\u2019s license with Apple Wallet,\u201d said Melissa Gillett, director of the Iowa Motor Vehicle Division. \u201cPrivacy and security have been at the forefront of our mobile driver\u2019s license development process and we appreciate Apple\u2019s proven reputation in these areas, as well as the shared commitment to following the ISO 18013-5 standard.\u201d \u201cThe Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is excited to be leading the pack through this innovative collaboration with Apple to further deliver on our pledge to take driver licensing to the next level,\u201d said Matt Cole, commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Vehicle Regulation. \u201cThe potential for mobile driver\u2019s licenses is limitless, and we look forward to taking steps to continue to offer modern conveniences to Kentuckians while maintaining our unwavering commitment to security and privacy.\u201d \u201cMaryland is proud to be a leader once again in safe innovation with the implementation of mobile driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d said Maryland Governor Larry Hogan. \u201cAs we look to the future, we are committed to enhancing convenience and accessibility while maintaining the highest safety and security standards for our state and citizens.\u201d \u201cWe are excited to work with Apple on mobile IDs in Apple Wallet. This innovative project is yet another example of the momentum we are building as a state in our continued efforts to be a national leader in the digital transformation space,\u201d said Jerry Moore, CIO of the state of Oklahoma. \u201cUtah has always been a forward-looking state. We regularly hear from people who want to access their driver license through their phones,\u201d said Jess Anderson, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for Utah to work with Apple in an innovative use of technology. This secure mobile license adds convenience while helping keep Utah safe.\u201d Participating states and the TSA will share more information at a later date about when support for mobile driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet will be available in each state, and which TSA airport security checkpoints and select lanes it will be available at first. Apple Wallet\u00ae on iPhone and Apple Watch offers an easy, secure, and convenient way to do everything from paying for groceries to accessing your favorite entertainment venues. With Wallet, users can pay in-store, online, and in-apps with Apple Pay\u00ae, pay for and ride public transportation in cities across the globe, unlock their car, and access airline boarding passes, event tickets, and loyalty rewards programs. University and college students, as well as faculty can also tap their device to use their mobile student ID in Wallet to make purchases and get around campus. Coming soon, Wallet will also provide access to customers\u2019 home, apartment, and hotel keys, as well as corporate badges. More information on Wallet can be found at apple.com/wallet.

        "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today updated its iWork\u00ae suite of productivity apps with new features that enable users to present in powerful new ways and make it even easier to work with documents on the go. New tools in Keynote\u00ae make presentations more engaging, with the ability to show a live camera view of the presenter directly in slides, and more collaborative with multi-presenter control. Pages\u00ae makes it easier than ever to view and edit documents on the go by automatically displaying text and images in a single-column flow that is optimized for iPhone\u00ae. And Numbers\u00ae introduces pivot tables that bring powerful data analytics capabilities to iPhone, iPad\u00ae, and Mac\u00ae. \u201cWhether they are in the office, at school, or working remotely, users around the world love Keynote, Pages, and Numbers for their powerful features, ease of use, and seamless experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac,\u201d said Bob Borchers, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \u201cToday, we\u2019re adding even more power and capability to these apps with new productivity and collaboration features that enable anyone to create more personal and compelling presentations, make working with documents on iPhone a breeze, and bring full-featured pivot tables to mobile for the first time.\u201d New Ways to Present in Keynote Powerful new tools make Keynote presentations more personal, engaging, and collaborative. With the option to use the front-facing camera on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, users can now add live video directly to their presentations. This allows the presenter to appear alongside the content in their slide \u2014 ideal for lectures, how-to videos, and remote presentations through video conferencing apps. Live video objects can be easily resized or styled with masks, frames, drop shadows, and reflections for a more elegant look. Mac users can connect multiple external cameras to further enhance the live video experience, and they can even show the screen of a connected iPhone or iPad right on a slide for live, interactive demos. With a new multi-presenter option, everyone can now easily control a shared slideshow right from their iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Whether they are in the same room or presenting remotely, multiple users can take turns advancing slides. Once a user is done with their slides, they can return control to the host or let another co-presenter take over to seamlessly continue the group presentation. A New Pages Experience Optimized for iPhone People read Pages documents on iPhone more than any other device, and Pages now offers a new experience that makes reading and editing documents on the go better than ever. With the latest update, Screen View automatically displays text, images, and other elements in a single-column, continuous flow optimized for the iPhone screen. Text is enlarged to improve readability, photos and drawings are sized to fit the display, and tables can be scrolled horizontally. Screen View is available for all word processing documents and doesn\u2019t require any additional setup. When enabled, users still have access to the complete set of editing tools in Pages. And Screen View can be switched off at any time so users can see the page layout for their document before printing or publishing. Powerful, Easy-to-Use Pivot Tables with Numbers With its intuitive interface and ability to showcase data with beautiful graphics and charts, Numbers has always been the best way for users to get the most out of their data. And now with pivot tables, users can quickly summarize, group, and rearrange data to identify and analyze patterns and trends. Creating a pivot table in Numbers is quick and intuitive: Users can easily select the data to include, choose how to group and summarize it, and access other display options from the sidebar. The resulting pivot table appears in a clear layout that makes it easy for the user to read and gain insights. Users can visualize their pivot tables with insightful charts, share pivot data with others while keeping the source data private, and even import or export pivot tables to and from Microsoft Excel. Numbers is the first app to bring full-featured pivot tables to mobile, with the same set of features across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, giving users access to this powerful data analytics tool wherever they work. Additionally, Radar charts are a new chart type that makes it easy to visually compare multiple variables with similarities shown as overlapping areas, allowing differences and outliers to really stand out. And new filter options let users find duplicate entries and unique values in their data, or easily show or hide rows that match a specific value. Keynote, Pages, and Numbers also support the new translation features introduced in iOS 15, iPadOS\u00ae 15, and macOS\u00ae Monterey. Users can select text and quickly see a translation, hear it read aloud, and instantly replace the selection with the translated text. Availability Keynote, Pages, and Numbers come free on every new iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Today\u2019s updates are available to download on the App Store\u00ae and Mac App Store. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

        "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple\u00ae today announced that Apple Business Essentials\u2122 is now available to all small businesses in the US. The new service brings together device management, 24/7 Apple support, and iCloud\u00ae storage into flexible subscription plans. Apple also unveiled new AppleCare+\u2120 for Business Essentials options that can be added to any plan. Additionally, a two-month free trial will be available to all customers, including those who have been using Apple Business Essentials in beta. \u201cApple has a deep and decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive. From dedicated business teams in our stores to the App Store Small Business Program, our goal is to help each company grow, compete, and succeed,\u201d said Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of Enterprise and Education Marketing. \u201cWe look forward to bringing Apple Business Essentials to even more small businesses to simplify device management, storage, support, and repairs. Using this new service leads to invaluable time savings for customers \u2014 including those without dedicated IT staff \u2014 that they can invest back into their business.\u201d Apple Business Essentials supports small businesses throughout the entire device management life cycle \u2014 from device setup, to device upgrades \u2014 while providing strong security, prioritized support, and data storage and backup. The complete solution begins with simple employee onboarding, allowing a small business to easily configure, deploy, and manage Apple products from anywhere. With the Collections feature, groups of apps can be delivered to employees or teams, and settings can be automatically pushed to devices, such as VPN configurations, Wi-Fi passwords, and more. Employees simply sign in to their work account on their iPhone\u00ae, iPad\u00ae, or Mac\u00ae using a Managed Apple ID. Once they sign in, they will have access to everything they need to be productive, including the new Apple Business Essentials app, where they can download work apps available to them. Managed Apple IDs can be created by federating with Microsoft Azure Active Directory and, coming later this spring, with Google Workspace identity services, allowing employees to log in to their device with a single business username and password. Apple Business Essentials works with company-provided and personally owned devices, and with Apple\u2019s User Enrollment feature, employees\u2019 personal information stays private and cryptographically separated from work data. In addition to a streamlined setup, Apple Business Essentials provides a dedicated iCloud work account for simple and secure storage, backup, and collaboration on files and documents. Business data is automatically stored and backed up on iPhone or iPad, making it easy to upgrade to a new device. And iCloud Drive\u00ae keeps information synced across Mac, making it easy to move between devices at work. AppleCare+ for Business Essentials Beginning today, businesses have the option to add prioritized support for employee devices with AppleCare+ for Business Essentials. This service includes 24/7 access to phone support, training for both IT administrators and employees, and up to two device repairs per plan \u2014 by individual, group, or device \u2014 each year. Employees can initiate repairs directly from the Apple Business Essentials app, and an Apple-trained technician can come onsite in as little as four hours to get their iPhone back up and running.1 \u201cEspresso machines are the last piece of food service equipment art, and the centerpiece of every cafe. We take pride in being part of the international coffee community with a superior customer experience in the Milwaukee area,\u201d said Peter Kelsch, Espresso Services Inc.\u2019s president. \u201cI started this business in 1989 on Apple products, and now iPhone, iPad, and Mac are used across sales, operations, and service for our coffee equipment business. Apple Business Essentials makes deployment and security simple for our business as we continue to grow, and will reduce our IT management overhead and streamline our growth process. It\u2019s going to be a game-changer for our business.\u201d Pricing and Availability Apple Business Essentials is now available as a subscription for all small businesses in the US. Flexible plans can be customized to support each user and device in an organization with up to 2TB of secure storage in iCloud, starting at $2.99 (US) per month after a two-month free trial. Plans that include AppleCare+ for Apple Business Essentials start at $9.99 (US) per month. Sign up today at apple.com/business/essentials. 1 Onsite repairs are available with AppleCare+ for Business Essentials plans in Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York City, and the San Francisco Bay Area to start, with more locations to come. Four-hour repairs are available for iPhone only; next-day appointments are available for Mac, iPad, and Apple TV\u00ae. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

        "text": "In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier \u201cgo-to\u201d player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies\u2019 high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it\u2019s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers\u2019 own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry as a \u201csilicon shield\u201d by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing\u2019s control. Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple\u2019s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Taiwan Semiconductor News and Updates 12/20/2024 The Biden administration is planning to blacklist Sophgo, a Chinese company illegally using a Taiwan Semiconductor chip in a Huawei AI processor. The chip, which was found in Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910B, matched one ordered by Sophgo from TSMC. 12/18/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s Arizona-based chip fabrication plant is almost back on schedule according to the company\u2019s Chairman, Rick Cassidy. The Arizona plant is the most advanced chip fabrication facility in the United States, producing 4-nanometer chips. 12/16/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s stock price experienced a slight increase of 0.1% today, trading as high as $205.50. However, trading volume was lower than average, with only 5.8 million shares changing hands. 12/12/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s stock price dipped 0.5% today, trading as low as $192.21. 12/11/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor has released a new report illustrating a solid financial performance for November 2024. The company\u2019s revenue for the month reached NT$276.06 billion, marking a 34% year-over-year increase. 12/9/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s stock price declined slightly today, trading as low as $199.16. The stock traded lower than its previous closing price, with a significantly lower than average trading volume. 12/6/2024 Nvidia\u2019s stock price experienced a slight decline of 0.4% to $144.48 in early Friday trading. However, for the week, the stock has seen a 4.8% increase. 12/5/2024 Tawaian Semiconductor may soon be making Nvidia\u2019s powerful new Blackwell AI chips. Production on the chips could begin as early as next year at TSMC\u2019s new factory in Arizona, which is currently under construction. Currently, the chips are manufactured in Taiwan at TSMC\u2019s main plants. However, while the initial stages of production can occur in Arizona, the chips would still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for final packaging. 11/27/2024 Taiwan Semiconducter\u2019s large investment in U.S. manufacturing was a strategic move to diversify its operations and address geopolitical tensions. However, experts suggest that the advanced chip production capabilities in the U.S. may lag behind those in Taiwan for some time. 11/26/2024 Taiwan Semiconductor experienced a slight decline of 0.1% in its share price today, trading as low as $183.87. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple\u2019s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with \u00d8rsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan\u2019s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world\u2019s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company\u2019s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That\u2019s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry\u2019s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is \u201cbuy\u201d(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 2.16% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street\u2019s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors\u2019 price is $183.92, which is -10.86% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don\u2019t anticipate as big of a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s Next 5 Years\u2019 Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan\u2019s entire energy output, its \u00d8rsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026\u2019s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company\u2019s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM\u2019s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company\u2019s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 23.39% gain over today\u2019s stock price. Year P/E Ratio EPS Price 2025 22 $8.36 $183.92 2026 20 $9.30 $186.00 2027 22 $9.40 $206.80 2028 20 $10.70 $213.90 2029 20 $12.30 $245.99 2030 18 $14.14 $254.59 Want to Retire Early?
