MSFT,2019-09-24 18:25:00,Game On (Your Phone): T-Mobile and Microsoft Team Up on Project xCloud Game Streaming,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/game-on-your-phone-tmobile-and-microsoft-team-up-20190924.jpg,businesswire.com,"BELLEVUE & REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Two major players, changing the gaming game. Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced a technical partnership to deliver the future of gaming in the U.S. with Project xCloud, beginning next month. The companies are working together to optimize the game streaming experience in the U.S. and learn more about the way gamers play games on mobile devices by streaming popular Xbox console titles over LTE. The deal combines Microsoft’s expertise in cloud and gaming with the strength and reach of T-Mobile’s LTE network today and vision for broad and deep 5G in the future. The public preview of Project xCloud will enable consumers to experience Xbox games streaming over LTE to a smartphone or tablet. “Mobile game streaming is the future and has the potential to unlock console-quality game play anywhere. I for one want to be at the forefront of that revolution driving it forward,” said Neville Ray, Chief Technology Officer at T-Mobile. “That’s why Microsoft chose T-Mobile and we answered … so T-Mobile customers can be some of the first to give this revolutionary service a try and to make sure our network is primed for the mobile game streaming future!” Project xCloud is Microsoft’s game streaming technology that empowers gamers to play console-quality games anywhere they are, on the mobile and tablet devices they already own. Microsoft’s approach to game streaming combines nearly 40 years of gaming experience with resources and investments from across the company, including Azure’s cloud footprint and an array of content from Xbox Game Studios. The technical partnership allows both companies to work together to better optimize the gaming experience for players in the U.S. Supported by T-Mobile’s newest, most powerful LTE signal, 600 MHz, cloud gaming will let gamers experience console-quality games on their smartphones and tablets from virtually anywhere they want to play. No signal goes farther or is more reliable. “We chose T-Mobile as our technical partner for the Project xCloud preview in the US to leverage their mobile expertise as we embark on the next phase of our cloud gaming journey,” said Kareem Choudhry, Corporate Vice President, Project xCloud. “T-Mobile’s strong network performance, excitement for gaming, and partnership will help us better understand how to meet the needs of gamers.” Starting in October, Microsoft will invite a limited number of players into the Project xCloud public preview to stream popular Xbox titles over T-Mobile’s advanced LTE network to their smartphones and tablets. Starting with Android, the preview will include Gears 5, Halo 5: Guardians, Sea of Thieves and Killer Instinct with more titles and devices coming over time. Microsoft will combine its expertise in gaming with the reach of T-Mobile’s advanced nationwide LTE network and extensive experience in streaming services to leverage learnings from the U.S. Project xCloud preview and ensure they are delivering the best game streaming experience to customers. The Un-carrier envisions a future of gaming that’s even more robust and immersive with broad and deep nationwide 5G from the New T-Mobile, if regulators approve the proposed merger with Sprint. While game streaming will work on today’s LTE networks, broad and deep nationwide 5G opens the future possibility for an enhanced gaming experience with cutting-edge game streaming technology such as augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. T-Mobile delivers network performance that’s neck-and-neck with competitors and now covers 326 million people with LTE — 99% of Americans. That’s all thanks to unprecedented investments in people and technology over the last three years, including adding one million square miles of new LTE coverage, adding more than 25,000 towers and cell sites, hiring more than 3,000 full time engineers and upgrading every single LTE cell site across the entirety of the network to deliver LTE-Advanced speeds and performance. To achieve these network enhancements, T-Mobile spent nearly $30 billion, with $7.99 billion dedicated to purchasing 600 MHz airwaves covering 100% of the U.S. — the company’s largest investment ever. Gamers can sign up for a chance to participate in the Project xCloud public preview at http://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-streaming. T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers will need an unlimited data plan, a smartphone or tablet running Android 6.0 or higher with Bluetooth 4.0; a Microsoft account; and a Bluetooth-enabled Xbox One Wireless Controller.

MSCI（NYSE：MSCI）とマイクロソフトは、世界の投資業界でイノベーションを加速するための戦略的提携を結びました。マイクロソフトのクラウドおよびAI技術の力と、MSCIの投資判断支援ツールが持つ世界的影響力が結び付くことで、両社は業界で新たなイノベーションを解き放ち、資産運用会社、資産保有者、ヘッジファンド、銀行など、世界で最も高度な投資家の間でMSCIの顧客体験を強化します。 当初両社は、MSCIの既存の製品、データ、サービスを、優先的クラウド・プラットフォームとしてAzureに段階的に移行することに重点を置きます。まずはインデックスおよび分析ソリューション、続いて環境・社会・ガバナンス（ESG）製品および格付け、不動産データおよびソリューション、MSCIのリスク分析プラットフォームのBeonを移行させます。MSCIのデータ・分析サービスとインフラストラクチャーが最新化されることで、両社は、投資家がデータをより迅速かつ効率的に管理し、リスクとパフォーマンスの推進要因を理解する上で役立つ新たな能力を提供できるようになります。 さらに、MSCIとマイクロソフトは、マイクロソフトのAzureおよびPower PlatformとMSCIのESGおよび気候ソリューションの能力を活用し、気候変動リスクとESGソリューションを推進する協業の機会を模索します。この将来の協業は、持続可能性に対する両社の取り組みに沿ったもので、投資家は気候変動がもたらすビジネス・リスクと機会をより適切に理解して解釈できるようになります。

David Turek will represent CATALOG and Don Doerner and Turguy Goker will represent Quantum. All three new board members bring to the Alliance extensive storage expertise and experience launching new technologies. “SNIA welcomes the expansion of the DNA Data Storage Alliance board with the addition of Quantum and CATALOG. We are excited to see the Alliance expanding its membership and continuing to support the emergence of this important technology,” said Dr. J Metz, Chair, SNIA Board of Directors. “With their talent and experience, David, Turguy, and Don will be excellent additions to the board. They’ll help guide this nascent industry through the next phase, address the inevitable challenges, and eventually reach a broader consumer base for these innovative technologies.” “At this pivotal moment in the evolution of DNA data storage, when the fundamentals of DNA synthesis and sequencing have progressed to the point where the storing of digital data in DNA molecules is technically feasible, it is vital to come together as an industry and implement standards that coalesce the whole sector in the drive to scale to commercially deployable systems,” said David Turek, chief technology officer of CATALOG Technologies. “I look forward to working with my fellow board members to help guide the Alliance toward this goal.” “Bringing together diverse experience in storage media and technologies is critical to ensure that DNA data storage moves toward standardized interoperability and ultimately broad adoption by customers,” said Turguy Goker, director of Advanced Development, Linear-Tape Open (LTO) at Quantum Corporation. “SNIA and the DNA Data Storage Alliance are already making great strides to make this goal a reality.” “DNA data storage is primed to be a game-changer in data storage, providing the ability to efficiently store vast amounts of data for a long time,” said Don Doerner, technical director, Office of the CTO at Quantum Corporation. “As an industry, we should embrace this potential, and I look forward to playing my part to help usher in this new era for the storage sector.” David Turek joined CATALOG from IBM where he held numerous executive positions in high-performance computing and emerging technologies. Achievements include: acting as the development executive for the IBM SP program, which produced the first commercially successful, massively parallel system; starting IBM’s Linux Cluster business; and launching an early offering in cloud computing called Deep Computing Capacity on Demand; producing the Roadrunner system, the world’s first petascale computer; and managing IBM’s exascale strategy, which led to the deployment of the Summit and Sierra systems at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories respectively. He has been invited to testify to Congress on numerous occasions regarding the future of computing in the United States and has helped establish technical collaborations with universities, businesses, and government agencies around the world. Turguy Goker represents Quantum with LTO organizations and leads the Advanced Development Team focused in LTO technology. He is a servo signal processing technology expert, with more than 30 years of experience in researching and designing tape drives, specifically LTO. Turguy has been one of the key contributors for researching low flying heads for HDD systems and was a key member of a small R&D team that was responsible for the original LTO project collaborating with HP Inc. and IBM, helping the formation of today’s LTO organization and tape technology. Early in LTO, Turguy helped design and develop reel-to-reel motion control systems and the actuator tracking servo algorithms. Later in his career, he managed the LTO Advanced Development Team for Quantum. He has been responsible for developing next-generation data detection methods and electronic control concepts (ECC), including application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation and high-performance dual actuator-based adaptive servo control algorithms for multi-channel tape systems. Turguy holds a master’s degree in electrical engineering from San Diego State University. Don Doerner joined Quantum in 2006 and is presently in the Office of the CTO, responsible for technology strategy, vision, and leadership of Quantum products. He is well-versed in storage and networking technology and has served in both engineering and product management roles at Quantum. His past projects include designing and implementing campus-area networks, automated tape storage libraries, error recovery algorithms for advanced tape storage devices and non-volatile memory express (NVMe)-based storage systems. He has led proofs-of-concept involving storage technology, such as object-based file systems, erasure coding and redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID). Don holds a master’s degree in mathematics and a bachelor’s degree in physics, both from the University of New Mexico. About the DNA Data Storage Alliance The DNA Data Storage Alliance was formed in October 2020 by Illumina, Microsoft, Twist Bioscience and Western Digital.

Since the first day the market opened in 2023, shares have gained 837.17%, and in the decade from August 2014 to present, they are up a preposterous 29031.91%. In June 2024, NVIDIA underwent its sixth stock split, further fueling demand for its shares as the company surged upward and is now the second largest by market cap. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect enormous upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA News and Updates 11/27/2024 Nvidia is reportedly prioritizing Samsung’s GDDR7 memory for its upcoming GeForce RTX 50 series of graphics cards for desktops and AI notebooks. 11/26/2024 Nvidia has been working with a team of global researchers on a groundbreaking AI model, Fugatto (short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1). This versatile tool can generate or transform audio in countless ways: it can create music from simple text prompts, alter a singer’s emotion or accent, and add or remove instruments from existing songs. 11/25/2024 Nvidia’s stock declined by nearly 4% today, reaching a three-week low. 11/22/2024 PhillipCapital has downgraded Nvidia from “Buy” to “Accumulate” due to recent price swings as the company’s Blackwell processors prepare for production. Despite the downgrade, however, PhillipCapital raised the target price for Nvidia from $155 to $160. 11/21/2024 Nvidia reported impressive third-quarter earnings, surpassing analysts’ expectations. The company’s strong performance was largely driven by the robust sales of its high-powered AI chips. Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion, outperforming the projected EPS of $0.74 and revenue of $33.2 billion. 11/20/2024 Nvidia’s shares dipped by 2% today ahead of the company’s much-anticipated earnings report. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, attributed the market’s jitters to concerns over Nvidia’s earnings and geopolitical tensions. 11/19/2024 Investors are closely watching Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report, set to release tomorrow following the bell. Recent reports of overheating issues with the company’s new Blackwell GPUs have raised concerns about potential delays and design changes. Investors will be looking for insights and the company’s overall outlook during the earnings call. 11/18/2024 When installed in high-capacity server racks, Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell data center processors overheat. This has led to the need to redesign the server racks, which in turn could potentially delay shipping for the processors. If the redesign and shipping of the processors do not occur on time, Nvidia’s major customers (Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc.) will be forced to delay their own timelines. 11/15/2024 As Nvidia prepares to release its earnings report next week, several top analysts have increased their price targets for the company. HSBC’s Frank Lee has been the most optimistic, raising his target to $200, implying a potential 36.78% upside. Susquehanna’s Christopher Rolland and Oppenheimer’s Rich Schafer also increased their targets to $180 and $175, respectively. In contrast, Raymond James’ Srini Pajjuri lowered his target to $170, although he still views any potential dip in Nvidia’s stock price as a buying opportunity. 11/14/2024 Nvidia is scheduled to report its third-quarter financial results a week from today. Analysts predict a rise of 82% year-over-year in sales to $33.04 billion and an earnings increase to 75 cents a share. The Susquehanna Financial Group raised its price target for Nvidia from 160 to 180. NVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $222.77 billion and $813.90 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.42 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) — account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants [that] are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $150.00, which represents a nearly 9.55% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $136.92. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 ‘Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share.

Our high-end price target is $431.20, while our low-end price target is $184.40. NVIDIA Stocks Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that NVIDIA’s stock will be trading for $362.00, good for a 164.39% increase over today’s share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70. Meanwhile, our low-end price target is $217.20 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 30.

The agreement aims to minimize the potential impact of increased energy demand from data center construction on the state’s residents. A key part of the deal requires the tech companies to contribute $1.5 million annually for five years to the Indiana Community Action Association. 11/25/2024 Over 5,300 people have reported problems with Microsoft 365 this morning, with 86% citing Outlook issues, 9% Exchange, and 6% SharePoint. Microsoft initiated a fix around 9 AM EST, and reports that 98% of users have regained access. 11/22/2024 Microsoft’s earnings outlook for the second quarter of 2025 has been lowered by Zacks Research. Analyst V. Sawalka now predicts earnings of $3.10 per share, down from the previous estimate of $3.19. 11/21/2024 Microsoft’s stock price fell 1% today, trading as low as $410.29. 11/20/2024 Next month Michael Saylor, former MicroStrategy CEO, will pitch a Bitcoin adoption plan to Microsoft’s board of directors.

A recent report revealed that Microsoft pledged $150 million in cybersecurity services to the federal government in 2021, including access to the premium Microsoft 365 Government G5 suite. While this move was initially seen as an effort to bolster U.S. cybersecurity, some critics argue that it could also have anti-competitive implications, locking the U.S. government into Microsoft’s ecosystem, limiting competition, and potentially increasing costs. 11/15/2024 Microsoft is adopting a new format called CSAF as the company changes the way it shares information about security vulnerabilities. CSAF is easier for computers to read and will help organizations quickly identify and fix security problems. 11/14/2024 Microsoft is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for potential anti-competitive behavior in its cloud computing business. The FTC is concerned that Microsoft might be using its dominant position in productivity software to unfairly limit customers’ choices, particularly with the company’s cloud services making it difficult for customers to switch to other cloud providers. 11/12/2024 Despite a broader market downturn today, Microsoft rose 1.20% to $423.03. Microsoft’s 10-Year Market Smashing Results Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018. Share Price Revenues Net Income 2014 $46.16 $86.83 $22.07 2015 $46.70 $93.58 $12.19 2016 $56.21 $91.15 $20.54 2017 $72.26 $96.57 $25.49 2018 $108.04 $110.36 $16.57 2019 $138.06 $125.84 $39.24 2020 $205.01 $143.02 $44.28 2021 $286.50 $168.09 $61.27 2022 $276.41 $198.27 $72.74 2023 $330.72 $211.92 $72.36 TTM $465.39 $279.99 $86.18 Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Microsoft’s revenue grew 222% while its net income went from $22.07 billion to over $86 billion (in the trailing 12 months). A big driver of profits over the past decade was Microsoft’s Intelligence cloud business, which grew 18% annually and drove operating profits of $37.88 billion in 2023 from $8.44 billion in 2014. As Microsoft looks to the second of the decade, a few key areas will determine its performance. Key Drivers of Microsoft’s Stock Performance Productivity and Business Processes: Microsoft’s Office and Dynamics 365 solutions and its LinkedIn products currently make up around one-third of the company’s revenue. Office in particular holds a near monopoly in office productivity software and most 3rd party applications have embeds, making switching costs high for this business line. LinkedIn also does not have a solid competitor in the professional networking space. High growth rates in this segment, but Microsoft has the advantage of controlling its price on its high market share products. Intelligence Cloud: Microsoft’s Azure, OpenAI, GitHub, and SQL, among other cloud businesses, make up close to half of the company’s revenue. But the crown jewel is Azure which only makes up close to 30% of Microsoft’s revenue and grew 30% over the past year alone. The future of Microsoft will depend on Azure and its competition with Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS will determine which company will dominate the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and reward shareholders handsomely in the process. Personal Computing: Windows, gaming, search, and devices are currently 25% of Microsoft’s business and this segment is the most open to competitors eroding market share. Outside of Windows, which has a solidified market share (and is not likely to dwindle), Microsoft search and devices will be facing a steep uphill battle over the coming years. Its acquisition of Activision is a positive for its gaming line but personal computing will play an ancillary part in Microsoft’s future. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Microsoft stock is $500.00, which is a 17.22% upside from today’s stock price of $426.55.

MSFT,2024-12-27 04:30:39,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-price-prediction-and-forecast-20241227.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tens of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 12/20/2024 Morgan Stanley analysts have lowered their price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $169 to $158, while maintaining an “equal weight” rating on the stock. Despite this lowered target, it still suggest a potential upside of 30.75% from AMD’s current price. 12/18/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock has reached a 52-week low of $121.82, valuing the company at $199 billion. This decline, coupled with a beta of 1.64, indicates significant price volatility as investors grapple with economic uncertainties and shifting market dynamics. 12/16/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock price dipped 1.3% in midday trading today, reaching a low of $123.12. Trading volume was also much lower than average, with only 15.7 million shares changing hands. 12/12/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock experienced a slight decline of 0.2% during today’s midday trading, fluctuating between $129.13 and $129.92. Trading volume was also much lower than average. 12/11/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ CEO Lisa Su has been named Time Magazine’s CEO of the year. Since taking over in 2014, Su has orchestrated an incredible turnaround for the company, driving AMD’s stock price up by a staggering 3700%. 12/9/2024 Vivek Arya, an analyst with Bank of America, downgraded Advanced Micro Devices stock from “Buy” to “Neutral” and lowered its price target from $180 to $155. This downgrade follows Amazon’s executives reports of weak demand for AMD’s AI accelerators and led to a decline in AMD’s stock today. 12/6/2024 AMD’s stock price has gone down today. This decrease followed an Amazon executive’s report that the company hasn’t observed enough demand for AMD’s AI accelerators to warrant their sale through Amazon Web Services. 12/5/2024 Mizuho has lowered its price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $185 to $180, but still maintains a “Buy” rating on the stock. This revised target price suggests a potential upside of 26.64% from AMD’s current market price. 12/3/2024 Advanced Micro Devices stock declined 0.3% today, trading between $141.23 and $141.61. 11/27/2024 Advanced Micro Devices has solidified its commitment to Indian by inaugurating a new research and development center. This move aligns with the company’s previously announced $400 million investment in the country. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD’s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024.

AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 47.99% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 62.48% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20.

MSFT,2025-03-03 12:31:02,"Actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher says investing “is like planting seeds; nurture them, and they will grow into something remarkable”",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/actorturnedinvestor-ashton-kutcher-says-investing-is-like-planting-seeds-20250303.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Ashton Kutcher first got into the spotlight as a famous actor, but he’s now become a successful investor. Kutcher has been investing since 2009 and made early investments in Skype and Airbnb. He co-founded A-Grade Investments, which invests in startups long before their IPOs. He even has stakes in OpenAI, Anthropic, and Stability AI. He also offers great advice for investors, including this brilliant metaphor. He said, “[investing] is like planting seeds; nurture them, and they will grow into something remarkable.” Here’s what this great insight means for investors. Key Points Ashton Kutcher shares valuable advice that emphasizes long-term investing. Time in the stock market often beats timing the market, and you’ll save a lot of time too. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Don’t Try to Time the Stock Market Timing the stock market is one of the worst ways to approach investing. It’s hard to time price fluctuations to find meaningful entry and exit points for long-term profits. Furthermore, it takes a lot of time to attempt to time the stock market. You can spend hours looking at charts and end up losing money at the same time. Instead of timing the stock market, you should focus on spending more time in the stock market. Kutcher’s investments in Skype and Airbnb were great with foresight, but he had to endure the volatility of these startups before realizing his bigreturns. However, Skype and Airbnb are major success stories, not all investments pan out. However, timing the stock market can cause you to exit investments that continue to soar in the long run. Only Buy Companies That You Want to Hold for Five Years Waiting for investment seeds to grow into something spectacular requires long-term investing. Seeds don’t grow into trees after a few weeks. It takes multiple years for the power of compounding to generate meaningful long-term gains. While market volatility can cause some investors to panic, it’s easier to stay the course if you buy companies that you believe in. Investors should only initiate positions in growth stocks that they feel confident about holding for the next five years. Using this parameter can help investors avoid flashy stocks that capture headlines today and collapse after a few years. Buying companies with this mentality can also help you sleep better at night when the stock market closes. Give Yourself Long-Term Investing Goals You can’t set long-term goals around your long-term returns since that can lead to riskier investments. However, you can set goals around how much you contribute to your portfolio each month. Boosting your portfolio contributions is one of the best ways to grow your portfolio. This sounds obvious, but some people are more focused on finding an investment that might gain 100% than looking for ways to increase their portfolio contribution by 10% each year. Putting more money into the stock market allows investors to make less risky investments to achieve their financial goals. It also goes back to Kutcher’s saying about how a seed can turn into something remarkable. It’s great to plant one seed, but what if you could plant numerous seeds that turn into remarkable things? Investing more money makes that possible, and you can only increase your portfolio contributions by increasing your income or minimizing your expenses. It doesn’t take much time to reduce costs before you can’t reduce them anymore, so it’s good to prioritize income growth after you establish a budget.
